README for the P Cycling model seedings (by Rafael RianÃ§o Silva)

In order to obtain the seedings for 2 initial conditions of Reservoirs:

0 - Adapt the paths to your own device, on the files "run_multi_config.py", and 

1 - Choose reservoirs, values and number of config files to be generated on seedings.py
2 - Open terminal on main and type "make seedings"   

-> this will create the directory "seedings_files" and its subfile "Results"; 
-> Then runs "seedings.py" and redirects the generated config files into the seedings_file directory
-> Creates an evolve file
-> runs "run_multi_config.py" which runs simulations for all the config-files (directed into the "output" directory)

3 - Open terminal on "output" and copy the matrix-files, results of the simulations, into the "/seedings_files/Results" directory, by typing 

	$ cp *.dot /home/rafael/Desktop/BMSIS_Internship2021/P-Cycle-main/seedings_files/Results 
	$ cp *.txt /home/rafael/Desktop/BMSIS_Internship2021/P-Cycle-main/seedings_files/Results
	
	(remember to adapt the paths)
	
and then remove the now superfluous material on the output directory, by

	$ rm *.yaml
	$ rm *.txt
	$ rm *.dot
	$ cd ..	
	
4 - Create the plot by runing the .py file "generate_single_plot.py", by typing

	$ python3 processing/generate_single_plot.py seedings_files/Results/*.txt -c Atmosphere0 -c CCrust0 
	
	(change the reservoirs names to obtain the ones in study)
	
------> If it runs smoothly, the plot should appear on the main directory
